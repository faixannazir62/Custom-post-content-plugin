<h2>Custom Post Content Plugin</h2>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This plugin provides multiple options, allowing you to add selected post content through a shortcode. You can add content by selecting the post option and choosing the post to which you want to add this content. Each post comes with its own CSS field, eliminating the need to add CSS in the Customizer. We are thrilled to introduce new features, so stay tuned! This plugin will soon be available in the WordPress repository.</p>
